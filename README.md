# Reinspired-GP3
My original group project 3 was going to be a bland, quiz maker - I decided to make it into a game.

Background:  I wasn't quite content with making a quizmaker, especially seeing that I was going to be working alone on this project,
so I set out for something, not nessacerily unique, but more challenging and fun for me, and hopefully my audience.

Premise:  This program will do 6 things:
•  Register users, both players and admins and create a registry.
•  Login users, both players and admins.
•  Have users play in the arena, and be able to load monsters.
•  Have users be able to create monsters.
•  Have users be able to pull up their stats.
•  Have a masterlog at hand.

Expected questions:
•  Why didn't you make the createMonster and adminBuild exclusive to admins?
The work seemed tedious for something so unimpacted, meaning that the class had access to all the files in the first place, the
extra mirage of security didn't seem like it was worth it.  Especially because I am presenting this to a class, constantly logging
in seems quite counterinituitive.

•  Why is only monster base damage able to change?
At the end of the day, I am a beginner at programming, and simply did not know how to pull specific lines from the .txt file, and
when I got close, I got tired.  It is 12:25 AM, the day of class as I type this, and I still need to do my chart.

•  How did you skip the password?
Getline.

I would do a few more, but again, I have to do my chart.  If you are taking the time to read this, I thank you for your time!
